Tessellated Kernels is  a new class of kernel functions.....

## How to use TKL

If you only want to use TKL-SVM or build a Tessellated kernel, please look at these examples [1](https://talitsky.github.io/v1/example-regression) and [2](https://talitsky.github.io/v1/example-classification), as well as the basic functions for the [kernel](https://talitsky.github.io/v1/svm-training) and the [model construction](https://talitsky.github.io/v1/svm-training).

## What is Multiple Kernel Learning? 

To whom is interested in what MKL is, a good paper is [Multiple kernel learning algorithms](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/gonen11a/gonen11a.pdf) *M GÃ¶nen* or just read on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_kernel_learning).

## How to understand the TKL?

What is TKL and how to use it, you can read one of these articles [1](http://control.asu.edu/Publications/2021/Colbert_NIPS_2021.pdf) or [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05477). And we also have a shortened version on our [website](https://talitsky.github.io/v1/tkl-intro)
