## What is Kernel Learning?

Kernel methods for classification and regression (and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in particular) require selection of a kernel. Kernel Learning (KL) algorithms automate this task by finding the kernel , *k* from the set *K* which optimizes an achievable metric such as the soft margin (for classification).

To understand how the choice of *K* influences performance and robustness, three properties were proposed to characterize the set *K* - tractability, density, and universality. 
* *K* is tractable if *K* is convex (or, preferably, a linear variety) - implying the KL problem is solvable using.
* The set *K* has the density property if, for any *e>0* and any positive kernel, *k* there exists a *k* from *K* such that:\
 
$$
\|k - k\| \le e
$$
