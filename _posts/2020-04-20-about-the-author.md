Hello,

The software has been written and is maintained by:
* Brendon Colbert
* Aleksandr Talitckii
* [Matthew M. Peet](control.asu.edu)

if you are having a serious technical issue and neither the help commands nor the manual are helping, and believe there is a bug in the program, please report it to: [brendon.colbert@asu.edu](brendon.colbert@asu.edu) or [atalitck@asu.edu](atalitck@asu.edu). If there is a bug, we will add it to the known bug list and do our best to fix it.

Alternatively, if you would like to volunteer for the TKL development team, we would be happy to include you (no compensation - Sorry). Send an email to [mpeet@asu.edu](mpeet@asu.edu)
